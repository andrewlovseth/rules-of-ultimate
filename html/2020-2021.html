    <p id="preface_title"><a id="preface"></a>Preface</p>
<p id="prefaceBody">Ultimate is a sport that inspires players and fans alike because of its ability to develop and showcase the athleticism, skill, teamwork, and character of its participants. The arc of the disc in flight, the opportunity for each individual to contribute equally to their team’s success, and the trust given to each player to know and uphold the rules make ultimate a sport that is embraced for its fun and excitement on the field and for the community beyond it. As a low-cost sport requiring minimal equipment, offering single and mixed-gender play, and providing a format that builds communication and conflict resolution skills, ultimate provides a welcoming, high value experience for players and fans from a diverse set of backgrounds and experiences. The Official Rules of Ultimate 2020-2021 describes how the game is played, including how players self-officiate and apply the principles of Spirit of the Game in competition.</p>
    
    <ol class="main-rules">
        <li><a id="1"></a>Introduction
<ol>
    <li><a id="1.A"></a>Description: Ultimate is a non-contact, self-officiated disc sport played by two teams of seven players. The object of the game is to score goals. A goal is scored when a player catches any legal pass in the end zone that player is attacking. A player may not run while holding the disc. The disc is advanced by passing it to other players. The disc may be passed in any direction. Any time a pass is incomplete, a turnover occurs, resulting in an immediate change of the team in possession of the disc. Players are empowered to self-officiate using a framework governed by the principles of Spirit of the Game.
    <li><a id="1.B"></a>Rules Variations
        <ol>
            <li><a id="1.B.1"></a>Appendices included in these rules outline rules changes and additions specific to several variations of the sport.
            <li><a id="1.B.2"></a>Event Organizer Clause: The <span class="tooltip" title="The person(s) or entity organizing and responsible for a competition, whether it is a tournament, tournament series, league, single game, or other type of event. Responsibilities may include, but are not limited to competition rules, safety, event registration and event logistics.">event organizer</span> may modify rules relating to game logistics in order to suit the event. Examples include game length (game total), time limits (time caps), halftime length, number of timeouts, starting time point assessments, uniform requirements, and <span class="tooltip" title="Observers are non-player game officials whose job is to support the players in implementing a safe, fair, and efficient game. Observers carefully watch the action of the game, assist with communication, help uphold self-officiating and the Spirit of the Game, assist with resolving calls as needed, and perform other duties as described in Section 19">observer</span> operations. Any such change must be established before competition starts.
            <li><a id="1.B.3"></a>Captain's Clause: For games not subject to the event organizer clause,<i> </i>a game may be played under any variation of the rules agreed upon by the <span class="tooltip" title="A team member, who is eligible to participate in the game, and has been designated to represent the team in decision-making on behalf of the team before, during, and after a game.">captains</span> of the teams involved. Otherwise, any rules variations are subject to approval by the event organizer. 
        </ol>
    <li><a id="1.C"></a>General vs. Specific Rules: Many of these rules are general in nature and cover most situations. However, some rules cover specific situations and override the general case.    
</ol>
    
        <li><a id="2"></a>Spirit of the Game
    <ol>
        <li><a id="2.A"></a>Spirit of the Game is a set of principles which places the responsibility for fair play on the player. Highly competitive play is encouraged, but never at the expense of mutual respect among competitors, adherence to the agreed upon rules, or the basic joy of play.
        <li><a id="2.B"></a>All players are responsible for knowing, administering, and adhering to the rules. The integrity of ultimate depends on each player's responsibility to uphold the Spirit of the Game, and this responsibility should remain paramount.
        <li><a id="2.C"></a>It is assumed that no player will intentionally violate the rules; thus there are no harsh penalties for inadvertent infractions, but rather a method for resuming play in a manner that simulates what most likely would have occurred absent the infraction. An intentional infraction is cheating and considered a gross offense against the Spirit of the Game. Players are morally bound to abide by the rules and not gain advantage by knowingly committing an infraction, or calling one where none exists.
        <li><a id="2.D"></a>Players should be mindful of the fact that they are acting as officials in any arbitration between teams. Players must:
        <ol>
            <li><a id="2.D.1"></a>know the rules;
            <li><a id="2.D.2"></a>be fair-minded and objective;
            <li><a id="2.D.3"></a>be truthful;
            <li><a id="2.D.4"></a>explain their viewpoint clearly and concisely; 
            <li><a id="2.D.5"></a>allow opponents a reasonable chance to speak;
            <li><a id="2.D.6"></a>consider their opponent’s viewpoint;
            <li><a id="2.D.7"></a>use respectful words and body language;
            <li><a id="2.D.8"></a>resolve disputes as quickly as possible;
            <li><a id="2.D.9"></a>make calls in a consistent manner throughout the game; and 
            <li><a id="2.D.10"></a>only make a call where an infraction is significant enough to make a difference to the outcome of the action.
        </ol>
        <li><a id="2.E"></a>The following are examples of possible actions to support good spirit:
        <ol>
            <li><a id="2.E.1"></a>informing a teammate if they have made a wrong or unnecessary call, caused a foul or violation, or need a clarification of a rule;
            <li><a id="2.E.2"></a>retracting a call when you no longer believe the call was necessary or believe that it was made in error and should not have been called;
            <li><a id="2.E.3"></a>complimenting an opponent for good play or spirit;
            <li><a id="2.E.4"></a>touching base with an opponent on the sideline after a contentious interaction;
            <li><a id="2.E.5"></a>discussing and/or making calls about contact that could be considered a foul in order to keep players safe;
            <li><a id="2.E.6"></a>introducing yourself to your opponent; and
            <li><a id="2.E.7"></a>reacting calmly towards disagreement or provocation.
        </ol>
        <li><a id="2.F"></a>The following actions are clear violations of the Spirit of the Game and must be avoided by all participants:
        <ol>
            <li><a id="2.F.1"></a>reckless play or dangerously aggressive behavior;
            <li><a id="2.F.2"></a>intentional fouling or other intentional rule violations;
            <li><a id="2.F.3"></a>taunting or intimidating opposing players;
            <li><a id="2.F.4"></a>disrespectful celebration after scoring;
            <li><a id="2.F.5"></a>making calls in retaliation to an opponent's calls or other actions;
            <li><a id="2.F.6"></a>calling for a pass from an opponent; and
            <li><a id="2.F.7"></a>other win-at-all-costs behavior.
        </ol>
        <li><a id="2.G"></a>Teams are guardians of the Spirit of the Game, and must:
        <ol>
            <li><a id="2.G.1"></a>take responsibility for teaching their players the rules and good spirit;
            <li><a id="2.G.2"></a>discipline <span class="tooltip" title="Any person designated by the team, to the event organizer, to be officially associated with the team, per the rules established by the event organizer.">team members</span> who display poor spirit; and
            <li><a id="2.G.3"></a>provide constructive feedback to other teams about what they are doing well and/or how to improve their adherence to the Spirit of the Game.
        </ol>
        <li><a id="2.H"></a>In the case where a novice player commits an infraction out of ignorance of the rules, experienced players are obliged to explain the infraction and clarify what should happen.

<ol>
    <li><a id="3.A"></a>Best perspective: The most complete view available by a player that includes the relative positions of the disc, ground, players, and line markers involved in a play. On an unlined field, this may require sighting from one field marker to another. Best perspective always belongs to a player. However, players may rely on the following sources as a component of best perspective:
        <ol>
            <li><a id="3.A.1"></a>Players may seek the perspective of <span class="tooltip" title="Any team member who is present at the field and eligible to participate in the game, but who is not a player participating in the current point.">sideline players</span> to clarify the rules and to assist players in making the appropriate call.

            </ol>
            <li><a id="3.A.2"></a>Players may review officially-designated video footage to assist in resolving a call where such footage is available. However, play may not be delayed to review video footage. <span class="annotation">[[For example, live instant replay in a stadium setting may be used by players to resolve a contested foul call.

        </ol>
        If no player has sufficient perspective to make a call, the disc should revert to the thrower (in the case of in-bounds/out-of-bounds and up/down disputes) or remain with the receiver on the end zone line (in the case of goal/non-goal disputes).
    
    <li><a id="3.B"></a>Completed pass: Any catch that results in the team in possession of the disc retaining possession. Any pass that is not complete is incomplete.
    <li><a id="3.C"></a>Foul: Non-Incidental contact between opposing players (see <a href="#3.F">3.F</a> for a definition of incidental contact). In general, the player initiating the contact has committed the foul.
    <li><a id="3.D"></a>Ground contact: All player contact with the ground directly related to a specific event or maneuver (e.g., jumping, diving, leaning or falling), including landing or recovering after being off-balance. Items on the ground are considered part of the ground.
    <li><a id="3.E"></a>Guarding: A defender is guarding an <span class="tooltip" title="A player whose team is in possession of the disc.">offensive player</span> when they are within 10 feet of that offensive player and are reacting to that <span class="tooltip" title="A player whose team is in possession of the disc.">offensive player</span>. <span class="annotation">[[A defender who turns away from an <span class="tooltip" title="A player whose team is in possession of the disc.">offensive player</span> and begins focusing on and reacting to the thrower is no longer guarding that <span class="tooltip" title="A player whose team is in possession of the disc.">offensive player</span>.]]</span>

    <li><a id="3.H"></a>Line: A boundary defining the playing areas. On an unlined field, the boundary is an imaginary line segment between two field markers with the thickness of said markers. Line segments are not extrapolated beyond the defining markers.
    <li><a id="3.I"></a>Pivot: The particular part of the body in continuous contact with a single spot on the field during a thrower's possession once the thrower has come to a stop or has attempted a throw or fake. When there is a definitive spot for putting the disc into play, the part of the body in contact with that spot is the pivot. <span class="annotation">[[This is not a body part, but rather an infinitesimally small point on the body.]]</span>
    <li><a id="3.J"></a>Possession of the disc: Sustained contact with, and control of, a non-spinning disc.
    <ol>
        <li><a id="3.J.1"></a>Catching a pass is equivalent to establishing possession of that pass.
        <li><a id="3.J.2"></a>Loss of possession due to <span class="tooltip" title="All player contact with the ground directly related to a specific event or maneuver (e.g., jumping, diving, leaning or falling), including landing or recovering after being off-balance.

        <li><a id="3.J.3"></a>A disc in a player's possession is considered part of that player. <span class="annotation">[[Thus, hitting the disc in a player's possession is a foul]]</span>
        <li><a id="3.J.4"></a>The team whose player is in possession, or whose players may pick up the disc, is considered the team in possession. If the disc is in the air following a legal pass, the thrower's team is considered the team in possession.
    </ol>
    <li><a id="3.K"></a>Pull: The throw from one team to the other that starts play at the beginning of a half or after a goal. It is not a legal pass for scoring and has many special provisions (Section <a href="#9.B">9.B</a>). The player on the pulling team who possesses the disc and signals readiness is the puller. <span class="annotation">[[The pulling team may designate a new puller at any time before the pull.]]</span>
    <li><a id="3.L"></a>Scoring attempt: A scoring attempt starts at the beginning of the game or when the previous goal is scored and ends when the next goal is scored.
    <li><a id="3.M"></a>State of the disc: The nature of play at a particular moment during the game. There are three states of the disc:
    <ol>
        <li><a id="3.M.1"></a>A disc is "in play" when players are allowed to move and play may proceed without the defense's acknowledgment. An in-bounds disc in the central zone is in play. The disc is subject to a turnover. If no player has <span class="tooltip" title="Sustained contact with, and control of, a non-spinning disc.">possession</span> of a disc in play, any <span class="tooltip" title="A player whose team is in possession of the disc.">offensive player</span> may become the thrower by taking <span class="tooltip" title="Sustained contact with, and control of, a non-spinning disc.">possession</span> of the disc (<a href="#14.A">14.A</a>). Once a player has <span class="tooltip" title="Sustained contact with, and control of, a non-spinning disc.">possession</span> of the disc, they must establish a pivot at the spot of the disc <a href="#14.A.2">14.A.2</a>) prior to attempting a pass (17.K).
        <li><a id="3.M.2"></a>A disc is "live" when players are allowed to move and the disc is subject to a turnover, but the thrower cannot make a legal pass (e.g., walking the disc to the spot where it is to be put into play). For a live disc to be put into play, the thrower must (1) establish a pivot at the appropriate spot on the field, and (2) touch the disc to the ground (<a href="#14.B">14.B</a>).
        <li><a id="3.M.3"></a>A disc is "dead" when play has stopped and can continue only with a check (see 9.D). The disc is not subject to a turnover.

Once a player has possession of the disc, they must establish a pivot at the spot of the disc 14.A.2) prior to attempting a pass (17.K).">in play</span> after a check depending on the circumstances.
    </ol>
    <li><a id="3.N"></a>Stoppage of play: Any halting of play due to a call, discussion, or timeout that requires a check or self-check to restart play. The term play stops means a stoppage of play occurs. <span class="annotation">[[Play-halting calls include "foul," "violation," "pick," "stall," etc.]]</span>
    <li><a id="3.O"></a>Throw: A disc in flight following any throwing motion (including a fake) that results in the thrower losing contact with the disc. <span class="annotation">[[Generally, a non-spinning, falling disc is not "in flight" unless it is intentionally dropped.]]</span>
    <ol>
        <li><a id="3.O.1"></a>A pass is equivalent to a throw.
        <li><a id="3.O.2"></a>An intentionally dropped disc is considered a thrown disc.
        <li><a id="3.O.3"></a>The act of throwing is the motion that transfers momentum from the thrower to the disc in the direction of flight and results in a throw. Pivots and wind-ups are not part of the act of throwing.
        <li><a id="3.O.4"></a>A throw is only considered complete when an <span class="tooltip" title="A player whose team is in possession of the disc.">offensive player</span> gains <span class="tooltip" title="Sustained contact with, and control of, a non-spinning disc.">possession</span> that is not otherwise negated.

However, the calling player may elect to treat the dangerous play as a general foul, if the player determines that the dangerous play was unrelated to the overall play that decided the outcome of the action. <span class="annotation">[[For example, if a third player appears and grabs the disc far before it reaches the two involved players, or if the disc is thrown to the opposite side of the field, the involved players will not be attempting a play on the disc. However, if multiple players accumulate under a floating disc, one player's dangerous play will be treated as a receiving foul, even if a third player happens to make a successful play on the disc, as the players under the disc were attempting a play on the disc. The calling player would have discretion to deem the third player's play so independent and removed from the involved players that the calling player wishes to treat the dangerous play as a general foul rather than a receiving foul. In general, a calling player's decision that a dangerous play was unrelated to the overall play will be based on the dangerous play being removed in significant distance or time from the overall play. By way of further example, even a dangerous play committed against a player unaware of the approaching disc will be treated as a receiving foul, where the offending player was attempting to make a play on the disc, giving the benefit of the doubt that the calling player could potentially have become aware of the approaching disc, had the offending player made a safe play.

    <div class="rulesBody">The following adaptations to the rules are recommended for youth ultimate competitions, as defined below. These adaptations may be additions to the current official rules or may supersede existing rules. Other than these additions and changes, the current official rules will apply to youth competition. </div>
    <div class="rulesBody">The goals for Youth Rules Adaptations are to modify the game to make it both safer and more developmentally appropriate for various age groups. The current age categories are a general approximation of development levels, and are also in part based on factors such as school levels and the breakdown of current age groups participating in the sport. These are likely to become more refined in the future.</div>

        <ol>
            <li><a id="D1.A"></a>There are not currently any requirements for rules adaptations for youth under this edition of the rules. Requirements are likely to come in future editions based on continued research and experience with adapting the sport for youth age groups.
